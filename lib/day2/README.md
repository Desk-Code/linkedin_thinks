*Say Goodbye to Grey Screen Errors in Your Flutter App!*

- Display a user-friendly error widget instead of a grey page when an error occurs.

- In debug mode or before pushing the application to production, a brief error detail will be displayed on a red screen, traditionally called the red screen of death, so the developer can trace what went wrong.



- but in a production (released) app, this is not the case. Instead, a grey screen is displayed, which is scary for a user.

*Is there a fix?*

Yes ðŸ˜Š A friendly custom error widget could be created and displayed using Flutterâ€™s ErrorWidget.builder method in the Material app builder method.

Note: errorDetails is an object of FlutterErrorDetails, more error details could be accessed through this errorDetails object:

errorDetails.summary (Property)
errorDetails.exception (Property)
errorDetails.exceptionAsString() (Method)
The mentioned string properties above could be parsed to the CustomFlutterErrorWidget as preferred by the developer.

For this application, when an error that could cause a grey page in production occurs, we would have this page below instead of a grey page:

The custom error widget being displayed in case of error here is more better for a better user experience.
