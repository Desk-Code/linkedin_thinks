In Flutter, MeshButton isn't a built-in widget, but you might be referring to a custom button with a mesh or 3D-like effect. You can achieve this using CustomPaint, ShaderMask, or MeshGradient (if working with shaders).

- A MeshButton in Flutter can be a custom-styled button that uses shaders, gradients, or a CustomPainter to create a mesh-like or 3D effect. This is useful for creating visually appealing buttons in applications with unique UI designs.
